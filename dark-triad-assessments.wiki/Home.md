# Dark Triad Assessments

Welcome to the Dark Triad Assessments repository wiki. This resource provides information on various psychological assessments used to measure the Dark Triad personality traits: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy.

## Introduction to the Dark Triad

The Dark Triad is a group of three personality traits that are characterized by malevolence:

1. **Machiavellianism**: Named after Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, this trait is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others, cynicism, and pragmatic morality.

2. **Narcissism**: Excessive self-love, grandiosity, pride, and a lack of empathy for others.

3. **Psychopathy**: Characterized by antisocial behavior, impulsivity, selfishness, callousness, and remorselessness.

These traits, while distinct, often overlap and have been the subject of extensive psychological research due to their impact on interpersonal relationships, workplace behavior, and various social outcomes.
