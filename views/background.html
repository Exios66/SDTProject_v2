    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>The Dark Triad and related personality assessments are crucial tools in understanding complex personality traits. These tests help identify tendencies towards manipulation, self-promotion, emotional coldness, and other characteristics associated with antisocial behavior.</p>
    <p>While these traits are often viewed negatively, research suggests they may also contribute to success in certain fields, such as business and politics. Individuals with high levels of Dark Triad traits may be more likely to take risks, pursue power and status, and excel in competitive environments. However, it's important to approach these assessments with an open mind and remember that personality is complex and multifaceted. No single trait or set of traits can fully define an individual, and the presence of Dark Triad characteristics does not necessarily predict negative outcomes or behavior.</p>
